        <h2>Nurudeen Omoniyi TAJUDEEN</h2>
        <p>I was born on September 21, 1997, in Kaduna State. <br> <br>
    
        My parents worked tirelessly to provide for our family, often working long hours and multiple jobs to make ends meet. <br> <br>
        
        Despite the challenges, they instilled in me the importance of hard work, education, and perseverance. <br> <br>
        
        Growing up, I was the second born of three siblings, and our family was close-knit. <br><br>

        After completing my high school education, I faced a major challenge of not gaining admission into the university for five years despite having a good JAMB score. However, I never gave up and eventually gained a scholarship to study BSc. Information Technology at the International Open University. <br> <br>
    
        Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science Education at Alhikmah University, while also working towards becoming a Software Engineer. Being the class representative for the past years has equipped me with leadership skills that I hope to continue to develop in the future. <br> <br>
    
        In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and learning new courses. I also love giving people beneficial information, as it really makes me happy to help others. <br> <br>
    
        Another significant turning point in my life was when I gained the scholarship to study at the International Open University, which opened up many opportunities for me. <br> <br>
    
        As for my personal life, I am still a student focused on pursuing my education, but I hope to start my own business and give back to the community through philanthropic endeavors in the future.</p>
